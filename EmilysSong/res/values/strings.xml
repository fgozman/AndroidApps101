    <string name="lyrics">John San what you can\n
La, la, Janette, dance in sand\n
What\'s the mystery, my son?\n
\n
Gypsy Dan Caravan\n
Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan\n
History, my son\n
\n
Murder and rape with your power\n
10th revolution in far away days\n
It\'s come to this, Gypsy\'s Kiss\n
All your power\'s gonna fade in the haze\n
\n
Jumme gae bile ya heed\n
Senorita said, I\'ll drag your lungs out through your nose\n
Space truckers free and high\n
Teamsters get ya by and by\n
That should keep you on your toes\n
\n
They got a gun at your head\n
But you ain\'t necessarily playing their game\n
They can\'t resist, Gypsy\'s Kiss\n
All that\'s needed to drive them insane\n
\n
John Wayne, The Alamo\n
Crazy Horse, Geronimo\n
I\'ll smoke a piece with you\n
\n
Mind, body, heart and soul\n
We got rock and roll\n
And there\'s nothing they can do\n
\n
Hear the small voice of truth\n
Above the shouting despair of the crowd\n
What do you wish? Gypsy\'s Kiss\n
Gets you strong for crying out loud\n</string>
