    <string name="csimagedescription1">Alan Turing picture</string>
    <string name="cscaption1">Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was a British mathematician, 
        logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, pioneering computer scientist, mathematical biologist, 
        and marathon and ultra distance runner. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, 
        providing a formalisation of the concepts of "algorithm" and "computation" with the Turing machine, 
        which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. 
        Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

    <string name="csimagedescription2">John von Neumann picture</string>
     <string name="cscaption2">John von Neumann (December 28, 1903 – February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian and American pure and applied mathematician, 
         physicist, inventor and polymath. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics 
         (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis),
          physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and fluid dynamics), economics (game theory), computing 
          (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.
           He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics, in the development of 
           functional analysis, a principal member of the Manhattan Project and the Institute for Advanced Study 
           in Princeton (as one of the few originally appointed), and a key figure in the development of game 
           theory and the concepts of cellular automata, the universal constructor, and the digital computer.
